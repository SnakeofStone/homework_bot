# Homework Bot

This program retrieves the data from my college website directly via
the automation framework "Selenium".

The credentials_template.json file should be filled with the information
required in it for the program to work.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment by running
> python3 -m venv selenium_venv

Source the virtual environment created by running
> source selenium_venv/bin/activate

Then update the pip installer
> pip install --upgrade pip

Finally install the requirements file by running
> pip install -r requirements.txt

in the folder where the repo is installed.

## Running
